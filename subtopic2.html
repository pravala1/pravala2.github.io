<li> "Abstract: In this Cornell Univeristy journal article, the speak on the rapid growth of AI generation in images and videos and how it challanges forensic detective technology due to its lack of interpretating issues and poor usage of classic models. The multiple authors go forth to speak on overcoming the issues through AIFo (Agent-based Image Forensics), which is a training free, agent-based forensic psychological framework, which helps make the work on analysis a little more human."

<li> "Abstract: This Michagen State University journal article focuses on their own personal researchers developing an AI enhanced method to help forensic psychological/anthropological work. They say that by training deep neural networks on radiographs they found out that they can speed up identification from around a weeks time to a few seconds. This plays a big part in helping in things such as missing persons reports and corrections, as well as possible amber alerts."
