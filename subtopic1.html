<li> "Abstract: In this research blog, Stack AI’s project manager, Divesh Punjabi, defines and explains in full length “pattern recognition,” and how it impacts our everyday lives. It (Pattern recognition in AI) is defined in this article as when a mechanical feature recognizes regularities and similarities within itself and more. He goes over the process, techniques, business benefits, challenges and real-world experiences, and even goes as far to have a frequently asked question section. This article uses a variety of technical jargon and language, yet explains itself in a somewhat simple way. Makes it easier to understand where we stand in the land of AI technological advancements intersecting into career paths ."

<li> "Abstract: In this Journal Article esque site, Dr. Maria Torres speaks on the growth of abstraction and analysis in AI (artificial Intelligence), in relation with crime scene investigations. Its said and spoken on the topic of AI helping Forensic/Psychology students put themselves into specific particular situations as practice. With Automated Crime Scenes, and the evolution of technology in this sense, cases are able to be solved faster. Such things that help them are educational programs focusing on fingerprint matching and digital forensics, helping reduce time ."
