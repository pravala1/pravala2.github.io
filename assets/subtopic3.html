<li> "Abstract: This Journal article explores how legal and administrative systems can serve as the main foundation for aligning artificial intelligence with human intentions and values. Rather than relying solely on abstract moral theories, it argues that established legal frameworks represent collective human volition developed through historical, social, and institutional processes. By examining concepts such as AI alignment and Coherent Extrapolated Volition, the author says that law offers a more practical and enforceable basis for guiding advanced AI systems. The paper emphasizes the importance of integrating legal norms, regulatory oversight, and ethical reasoning to ensure AI development remains accountable, transparent, and consistent with societal values."

<li> "Abstract: This journal article analyzes the legal and ethical risks of using generative artificial intelligence in judicial decision-making. Although generative AI has the potential to support courts by improving legal research efficiency and expanding access to justice, it also introduces serious challenges, including algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, and weakened judicial accountability. Drawing on case studies from jurisdictions such as Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and India, the authors illustrate how unregulated use can undermine judicial discretion and the rule of law. The article argues for safeguards to ensure that generative AI supports the integrity of judicial systems."
